## 5. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### 5.1 Data Security Measures

**Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT tokens (Bearer authentication)
- Token expiration & refresh
- Google OAuth integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Data Encryption**
- HTTPS/TLS for all API calls
- Passwords hashed (backend assumed)
- Stripe tokenization (PCI compliance)
- RSA-OAEP key generation (crypto.js)

**Input Validation**
- Zod schema validation (runtime)
- React Hook Form validation (client-side)
- Backend validation (assumed)
- XSS protection (React built-in)

### 5.2 HIPAA Compliance Considerations

**Protected Health Information (PHI) Collected**
```
- Health history
- Allergies
- Pregnancy details (due date, complications)
- Medical provider information
- Demographic data
```

**Current Compliance Measures**
✅ No client-side form storage (removed for HIPAA)
✅ Server-side data storage only
✅ HTTPS encryption in transit
✅ Role-based access control
✅ JWT authentication

**Gaps & Recommendations**
❌ **Encryption at rest**: Ensure Supabase database encryption
❌ **Audit logging**: Implement PHI access logs
❌ **BAA with vendors**: SignNow, Stripe, QuickBooks, Supabase
❌ **Data retention policy**: Define PHI retention/deletion rules
❌ **User training**: HIPAA awareness for staff
❌ **Incident response plan**: Data breach procedures
❌ **Access controls**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

**Recommended Actions for Full HIPAA Compliance**
1. Execute Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with:
   - Supabase (database)
   - SignNow (contracts)
   - Stripe (payments)
   - QuickBooks (invoices)
   - Vercel (hosting)

2. Implement technical safeguards:
   - Database encryption at rest
   - Audit logging (who accessed what PHI, when)
   - Session timeouts (automatic logout)
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - IP whitelisting for admin access

3. Administrative safeguards:
   - HIPAA training for all users
   - Data breach notification procedures
   - PHI access logs review (quarterly)
   - Data retention & destruction policy

4. Physical safeguards:
   - Secure workstation usage policy
   - Device encryption requirements
   - Screen timeout policies

### 5.3 Payment Security (PCI Compliance)

**Current Implementation**
✅ Stripe Elements (PCI-compliant card inputs)
✅ Tokenization (no card data stored locally)
✅ HTTPS encryption
✅ JWT authentication for payment APIs
✅ Admin-only charge permissions

**Status**: PCI compliance handled by Stripe
